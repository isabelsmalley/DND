# Lemon Person
Lemon people live under the tyrannical rule of the Earl of Lemongrab. 
Lemon people adventurers would be one of the very few who escaped to travel the world, like the legendary Lemonhope (who will return to save all Lemonfolk). 
Years of oppression often make lemon people sour to the world with little empathy. 
The Lemon People have varied appearances with some resembling animals, plants, or fungi more than humanoids.
